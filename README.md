## Hi ðŸ‘‹! It's me Usama, the roboticist wannabe.

Welcome to my GitHub portfolio! I'm a passionate engineer specializing in robotics, embedded systems, and software development. Here you'll find a collection of my projects, achievements, and contributions.

## About Me

I am deeply passionate about robotics and mechatronics engineering. My journey started as an Embedded Design Engineer at a Y-Combinator startup, and I have since gained experience in various aspects of engineering, including firmware development, cloud computing, edge computing, and more. I hold a Rector's Gold Medal for Best Project in the Mechatronics Engineering Department for my senior year projectâ€”a 6DOF serial robotic manipulator designed to feed food to patients and the elderly.
