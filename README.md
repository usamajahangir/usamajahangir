## 🚀 What I’m Up To
- 🔭 **On the Job:** Working as an **Algorithm Engineer** at **Software Motion**, crafting Object Trace Modules and sensor fusion algorithms (Camera + Radar) for Level-2 ADAS features (AEB, ACC, LCC).
- 📄 **Research:** Recently published *"[Assistive Feeding System: Design and Evaluation](https://doi.org/10.1109/ICRAI62391.2024.10894327)"* at the **6th IEEE ICRAI Conference**.
- ⚙️ **On My Own Time:** Digging deeper into **ROS2** navigation stacks and building my [portfolio website](https://github.com/usamajahangir/usamajahangir.github.io).

## ⚡ Fun Fact
I built a 6-DoF feeding robot 🤖 that nailed serving rice 🍚 during testing... but let's just say I was nervous when I tried it myself! 🛠️😅
